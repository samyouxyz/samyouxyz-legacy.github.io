It seems like you have to compress your intentions into a finite input space to transmit signals. So that means “building better interfaces” can be defined as reducing the compression work from humans and moving it toward computers.\n","permalink":"https://samyou.xyz/writings/interface-as-compression/","summary":"Computers love numbers.

I have been always figuring out how I can optimize the use of my time to learn what I want to learn. Many people are so smart that they can just read everything and understand everything. However, mother nature gave me a smol brain, so it is important for me to be frugal on the way I obsorb new information. Before deciding to invest time into understanding something, it should be intentional what and how to consume, sort of like a brain filter. From what I found so far, that may include, but not limited to:\nIs it foundational? Intelligence is simply a cyclic graph of knowledge embeddings . Understanding one knowledge node is fundamental for understanding several other nodes. Otherwise, less foundational node would not do as good — it can give context, but it is highly situational; thus, produce weak leverage. The simple subquestion we may ask, “can we understand A, B and C, if we don’t know about X?” If the answer is “no”, X is foundational.\nDoes it have a significant temporal relevance? It makes very little sense to invest time in acquiring knowledge that would be irrelevant within the next few days/weeks. For instance, the moment we depend on the mainstream media for obtaining knowledge, we are outsourcing our analytical thoughts to other people for the information that may be significant only for a short time. Thus, judging whether to expand the deep understanding on particular subject require durable time horizon of relevancy. The duration of significance is relative for different subjects and individuals.\nIs it mimetic or pragmatic? “Man is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind. We desire what others desire because we imitate their desires.” – René Girard.\nSometimes, it is funny how often and how easy people trick themselves into believing they understand something, while obviously they don’t (Dunning–Kruger effect ). Wait, but why? One of many reasons could be that it is easier and faster to imitate others. Why spend all the hard work when the perception of the result is identical? If you “feel” very smart after spending on an hour lecture or an inspirational documentary, it may or may not be true as much as you think it is. Sometimes, watching people speak in a certain way, do a certain thing, or gain influence on a certain thing, it would confused you not to think very deeply about the substance of it — just because it feels good and makes you feel smart.\nHuman is an emotional creature. The source of political power derive heavily from exploiting the emotional mechanics of, not how people think, but how people feel.\nOne question to ask would be, “can you produce anything from the knowledge you just acquired?” It could be anything from explaining, creating, inventing, or good questions, excluding imitation. If there is only inputs without new outputs, there is a high chance you are fooling yourself that you get it.\nWrapping up Despite being an imperfect creature living in the imperfect world, we strive to reduce the entropy — to bringing order to chaos. Knowledge is information compression. Having the right compression algorithms may be the crucial key in the pursuit of curiousity.\n","permalink":"https://samyou.xyz/writings/brain-filter/","summary":"One of the most valuable resource that everyone has is time.

The world has changed, but the education system has not. Lagging behind the evolution renders traditional school no more than a deadweight. Everybody is worrying about AI taking our jobs, just like the industrial revolution taking farmers’ jobs. It is bound to happen and it is a good thing.\nBut in fact, what we should worry about is get the generation ready for that. And to prepare for that, it is not to hit our kids when they got F on report card, it is not to force them to memorize searchable facts, it is not to compare them and put them in ranks like product ranking, and clearly not just put kids sitting down the whole day listening to list of boring facts. You are wasting your kids time, and eventually destroying their life. What you need to do is to teach them how to think, how to be creative, and how to be nice. These are what robots cannot do.\nHow can we fix traditional media’s business model? Started with angelic intention of disseminating truth of event, now media has become an arena of attention grab, which eventually has changed into disseminating falsified narrative. Media’s main business model is advertising. More clickbait, more view, more money, less truth. Maybe to fix the problem is to fix the whole business model of the media?\nHow can we build a modern transportation infrastructure? Urban traffic is driving people crazy. Not only does it sucks away your time and slowing you down, it also affect you mentally. People are annoyed arriving at work, becoming toxic, the toxicity gets modified in the office, now everyone is toxic. Toxic day, toxic life, toxic society, crappy productivity, depressed nation. Unfortunately, a solution for a city does not applicable to others. Some cities are cars 95%, and some 50%. The price of gas, the population density and living standard vary.\nFaster transportation, happier people, more productivity, less toxic, happy city!\nHow can we decelerate climate change? You have all heard this in your textbook since you were kids. Everybody is telling you it’s bad, but everyone is still doing it. Maybe instead of blaming anyone, the smart people of our generation should try new technology and figure it out together?\nHow can we create a scalable solution to help people with mental depression? With the internet, flood of information has overheat our head. Instead of you controlling, being controlled by social media breads comparison and self-expectation, thereby lowering self-esteem and lead to depression. With the population increase, the proportion of lonely people also increase. It is amplified when the society centers around competition, and less on creativity. Should we just let this become the survival of the fittest? Or should we aim for utopian?\nHow can we make boring but important idea appealing to the mass? Is there a way we can be trained to be a science communicator? Is there a way to make scientific papers readable to laymen, and still hold on to the technicality for other scientist?\n","permalink":"https://samyou.xyz/writings/questions/","summary":"How can we help children learn to think better?
