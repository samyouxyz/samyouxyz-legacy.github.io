      <description>üëãüèº Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Sam, full name is Ratanaksamrith You. I mostly focus my time on software engineering and research. My goal is to make machine smarter. If it works it is comparable to extending human life, because if we can delegate work to machine, we can get those time back, increasing the amount of useful time we have.
Previously, I worked at a crypto exchange in Seoul. Later on, I started working on a startup where I am working on an experimental product that let you listen to and mint music collectibles from across multiple platforms in a single interface.</description>
